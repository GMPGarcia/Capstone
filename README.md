SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing Prediction - IBM Data Science Capstone
This repository contains the capstone project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate course. The goal of the project is to predict whether the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will successfully land. This prediction is crucial because SpaceX significantly reduces launch costs by reusing the first stage, bringing the price down to 62 million dollars per launch compared to over 165 million dollars charged by other providers.

Accurate landing predictions can help estimate the cost of a launch, which is valuable information for companies competing with SpaceX in the space industry. The project involves data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model building using various machine learning techniques to achieve this prediction.
