## 1. Data Collection via API

**Notebook:** `1-Data-Collection-API.ipynb`  
This notebook demonstrates how to collect data using APIs related to SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches. The data fetched includes information on launch outcomes, payloads, and launch sites.

## 2. Data Collection via Webscraping

**Notebook:** `2-Data-Collection-Webscraping.ipynb`  
In this notebook, we use web scraping techniques to gather additional data from websites that provide Falcon 9 launch details, such as the payload mass, mission outcomes, and launch success rates.

## 3. Data Wrangling

**Notebook:** `3-Data-Wrangling.ipynb`  
This notebook focuses on cleaning and preprocessing the collected data. We handle missing values, format inconsistencies, and perform necessary transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis with SQL

**Notebook:** `4-EDA-SQL.ipynb`  
In this notebook, we conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL to examine various aspects of the Falcon 9 launch data, such as success rates and payload distribution.

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

**Notebook:** `5-EDA-Python.ipynb`  
Here, we use Python libraries (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib) to visualize and explore the dataset further. We create detailed plots and summaries to better understand the relationships between variables such as payload mass, orbit types, and launch success.

## 6. Launch Sites Locations Analysis with Folium

**Notebook:** `6-Launch-Site-Analysis-Folium.ipynb`  
Using Folium, this notebook visualizes the geographic distribution of Falcon 9 launch sites. We map the launch sites and analyze spatial factors that may impact launch outcomes.

## 7. Machine Learning Prediction

**Notebook:** `7-Machine-Learning-Prediction.ipynb`  
In this notebook, we apply machine learning models to predict the outcome of Falcon 9 launches. We explore various algorithms and evaluate their performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.
